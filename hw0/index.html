					He liked the program except when it repeated things and went absurd at times and believes that although it might be a stress releaser for people who have 
					no one to listen to them. The program according to him was a good listener and people could definitely talk about anything they would want. It might not 
					serve a psychatrist though but considering the fact that its a computer program, it was quite good, he said. (He knows a little stuff about AI.)<br>
					The absurdity of doctor in replying to his statements diverted their talk to a completely different phase at times and he would laught at times
					when the doctor would end up asking questions related to his sex life.<br>

					He allowed me to post the following parts from his conversation with the doctor. He found the following lines to be "human-like"<br>
					<pre>
i feel sad at times that i do not have true friends

Does it bother you that you do not have true friends?

yes

Maybe your life has something to do with this.

			The following made him think of the doctor as some sort of program just picking words from his replies.<br>
					<pre>
i have no way to convince my friends that it was not me

Does the fact that it was not you explain anything 
yes it was someone else

Are you sure it was not I explain anything yes it was someone else?

waht are me saying?
					</pre>
					<pre>
Earlier you said I am a doctor so you came to see me?

that is why i am telling all this stuff to you

Is it because you are telling all this stuff to I that you came to me?

actually NO. One of my good friends bothered me to talk to you. It is
part of his assignment. So i came to you. But you are nice to talk to

Did you ever regret I am nice to talk to?

				<h3>Source Code</h3>
				The doctor program uses elementary pattern matching on user input to produce a string as response to the user.
				Various keywords in the user input are used for constructing these replies so as to maintain the context. 
				It has been fed with some knowledge like brother, mother, father belong to family and other similar facts.
				It has been fed with knowledge of various parts of a sentence like
				<ul>
					<li>Adjectives</li>
					<li>Adverbs</li>
					<li>Articles</li>
					<li>Prepositions</li>
				</ul>
				It has also been fed with the knowledge of numbers, colors, sizes (like small, big, large etc), vowels. It has been made to understand drugs and alcohol, and various 
				other things related to normal life, doctors. A set of random adjectives and other such forms are also have been fed. 					
				<p>	
				Whenever the doctor fails to understand user input, it tries to continue the conversation by giving a very general response or by pointing to
				something said by the user in the past.
