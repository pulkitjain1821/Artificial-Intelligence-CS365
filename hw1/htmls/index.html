				<h2>1. K-NN Based Classifier </h2>
				<p>
					The K-NN classification  algorithm classifies a data point taking into consideration the k nearest data points that have already been classified. The most common class found in the k nearest neighbours is the class assigned to the data point to be classified. <br>
					The algorithms wes run for several values of k ranging from 1 to 50. The classifier was trained by the MNIST training data (60000 data points) set and tested for the MNIST test set (10000 data points). The distance used was Eucledian distance and was also used a tie breaker.<br>
					Following is the plot for the Percentage error in classification versus the k value.<br>

					<h4>Observation</h4>  K = 3 serves the best (error under 3%) for this data set and error, in general, increases as we increase K.		
				</p>

				
				<h2>2. Manifold based modelling of MNIST Digits</h2>
				<h4>Algorithm Description</h4>
				The algorithm learns the manifold in the high dimensional data. It first estimates the distances between the points along the manifold that it aims to discover. These distances are estimated as euclidean distances between k closest points or within an epsilon range. The distance metric can also be chosen as tangent distance, as we have done.
				The algorithm then tries to find out the points in the data set that are at the geodesic distances to learn the manifold embedded in the high dimensional space.<br><br>

				2-D Isomap embeddings for first 3000 data points (of required labels) in the MNIST training set were used for constructing isomaps. Value of k = 3 was chosen. Following are the plots obtained.
				<h4>Digits 1 and 7 (Eucledian Distance)</h4>
				<center>
					<img src = '1_7euc.jpg' width = '1000' height ='750'>
				</center><br>
				
				<h4>Digits 4 and 9 (Eucledian Distance)</h4>
				<center>
					<img src = '4_9euc.jpg' width = '1000' height ='750'>
				</center><br>		
				
				<h4>All Digits (Eucledian Distance)</h4>
				<center>
					<img src = 'alleuc.jpg' width = '1000' height ='750'>
				</center><br>		
				
				<h4>Digits 1 and 7 (Tangent Distance)</h4>
				<center>
					<img src = '1_7tan.jpg' width = '1000' height ='750'>
				</center><br>		
				<h4>Digits 4 and 9 (Tangent Distance)</h4>
				<center>
					<img src = '4_9tan.jpg' width = '1000' height ='750'>
				</center><br>		
				<h4>All Digits (Tangent Distance)</h4>
				<center>
					<img src = 'alltan.jpg' width = '1000' height ='750'>
				</center><br>		
				<h4>Observation</h4>  Clusters in the plots where tangent distance was used as metric are denser than the corresponding clusters in the plots where the metric was eucledian distance. So, tangent distance is a better metric for our data set.<br><br>

				<h2>2. Deep Belief Networks</h2>
				<h4>Working of the Deep Architectures</h4>
				Deep belief nets are generative models that are contructed from multiple layes of neural networks. In Deep nets, there is layer by layer learning of weights which determines the dependency of variables in one layer with the variables in the next layer.

				Various parameters of the deep learining toolbox provided were varied and following are the variations observed.
